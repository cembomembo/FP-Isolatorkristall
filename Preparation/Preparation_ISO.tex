\section{Introduction}

Ruby is a red variety of corundum (Al$_2$O$_3$) whose colour originates from small amounts of Cr$^{3+}$ ions replacing Al$^{3+}$ sites in the crystal.
Unlike pure corundum, which is colourless and transparent, the chromium impurities introduce electronic states that interact with visible light and give rise to characteristic absorption features.
In this experiment we measure the wavelength-dependent transmission of a ruby crystal using a two-beam absorption spectrometer.
From the recorded absorption bands we aim to understand the optical origin of the ruby colour and relate the observed transitions to the crystal-field splitting of the Cr$^{3+}$ ions.
The experiment therefore provides a direct link between optical spectroscopy and the basic concepts of crystal-field theory as applied to doped insulating crystals.

\section{Physical Principles}
\subsection{Crystal Structure of Corundum}

Corundum (Al$_2$O$_3$) is a transparent, colorless insulating crystal in which each Al$^{3+}$ ion is surrounded by six O$^{2-}$ ions in a slightly distorted octahedral arrangement (Fig. \Ref{fig:corundum}).
The negatively charged oxygen ions create an electrostatic field around every cation site.
In the case of Al$^{3+}$, this field has almost no optical consequence, since aluminium has no electrons in its outer \(d\)-shell and therefore no low-energy electronic states that could be shifted or excited by the surrounding oxygen ions.
The Al$^{3+}$ sites behave essentially like stable point charges that hold the lattice together without interacting with visible light.
For this reason pure corundum is colorless. The situation changes, however, when an Al$^{3+}$ ion is replaced by another ion that does carry \(d\)-electrons, creating a substitutional point defect and introducing new electronic states into this same electrostatic environment.

    \label{fig:corundum}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Substitution of Al\textsuperscript{3+} by Cr\textsuperscript{3+}}

When an Al$^{3+}$ ion in corundum is replaced by a Cr$^{3+}$ ion, the overall charge of the crystal remains unchanged because both ions carry the same charge.
The important difference is that Cr$^{3+}$ has three electrons in its outer $3d$ shell, whereas Al$^{3+}$ has none.
These $d$-electrons occupy orbitals with characteristic spatial shapes, and for this reason they are sensitive to the arrangement of neighbouring ions.
When a Cr$^{3+}$ ion sits in the octahedral environment of six O$^{2-}$ ligands, the electrostatic influence of these surrounding oxygen ions affects the energies of its $d$-orbitals.
This makes the electronic structure of Cr$^{3+}$ very different from that of Al$^{3+}$ and is the reason why chromium impurities can interact with visible light while pure corundum remains colourless.


\subsection{Crystal-Field Splitting of the Cr\textsuperscript{3+} d-States}

In a free Cr$^{3+}$ ion the five $3d$ orbitals all have the same energy, because in empty space there is no preferred direction.
Inside the octahedral environment of six O$^{2-}$ ions in corundum the situation changes because the orbitals point in different spatial directions (Fig. \Ref{fig:d_orbitals}).

\vspace{1em}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{../resources/figures/dOrbitals.png}
    \caption{Directional shapes of the five $d$-orbitals shown relative to the coordinate axes and ligand directions in an octahedral environment. Orbitals that point along the axes experience stronger repulsion from approaching ligands than those pointing between the axes \cite{libretexts_d_orbitals}.}
    \label{fig:d_orbitals}
\end{figure}

Three of the $d$-orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) point between the axes and therefore between the surrounding oxygen ions, so they experience relatively little repulsion.
The remaining two orbitals ($d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$) point more directly toward the oxygen ions and feel a stronger electrostatic repulsion.
As a result the originally degenerate $d$-orbitals split into a lower-energy group of three and a higher-energy group of two.

For a Cr$^{3+}$ ion with three $d$-electrons this splitting means that all three electrons occupy the lower-energy orbitals, following Hund’s rule.
Light can be absorbed when one of these electrons is promoted from a lower orbital to one of the higher-energy orbitals.
The energy needed for such an excitation corresponds to specific colours of visible light, which is why chromium impurities in corundum produce distinct absorption bands and give ruby its characteristic colour.
